        <p>At Notes lab, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data. This Privacy and Security Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you visit our website.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Protection & Privacy:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimal Data Collection:</strong> The platform only collects essential data such as user registration details (e.g., student email, username) for account creation. No unnecessary personal information is collected to minimize data exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidential Academic Data:</strong>    Access to notes and academic materials is granted only to authorized users—students enrolled in specific courses or subjects, as determined by their registration and access rights </li>
            <li><strong>User Control Over Data:</strong> Students     and professors can access, update, and delete their personal information and academic content at any time via their user profiles. Data retention policies are enforced, meaning personal and academic data are kept only as long as necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Account Security:</h2>
        <ul>
            
            <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> Students and professors are required to log in using strong authentication methods. Passwords are securely hashed and stored, ensuring that even if the server is compromised, user passwords cannot be accessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> Professors have exclusive rights to upload and manage the notes they’ve provided. Students can only view materials relevant to their registered courses. Administrators manage user roles and permissions to ensure that users can only access appropriate content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3.Content Security: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access Control for Notes:</strong> Notes and academic content are accessible only to students who have enrolled in the corresponding courses. Unauthorized access to content is prevented through secure login mechanisms and course-specific access controls.</li>
            <li><strong>Copyright Compliance:</strong> All notes shared by professors are protected by intellectual property laws. Professors have the right to control access to their materials, ensuring that their content is not shared or distributed outside of the approved student group.</li>
            <li><strong>File Security and Scanning:</strong> Uploaded files (e.g., lecture notes, PDFs) are scanned for malware or viruses to prevent malicious content from being shared with users. Additionally, files are stored securely in the server with appropriate access restrictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion:</h2>
            <li><strong>Data Retention Policy:</strong> Personal data and academic materials are retained for a predefined period, after which they are either deleted or anonymized. For instance, student data may be retained for a semester or until course completion, whichever is applicable.
            <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Students can request the deletion of their account and personal data at any time. Professors can also remove their uploaded notes from the platform, ensuring that outdated or irrelevant materials are no longer accessible.
            <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> Where possible, personal information linked to academic records may be anonymized for use in aggregate data reporting, reducing the risks of exposure.
        <h2>5.Privacy Policy and Transparency:</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Privacy Policy:</strong> A transparent privacy policy outlines what data is collected, how it is used, who has access to it, and how long it is stored. The policy is easily accessible to all users and updated regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>GDPR and Compliance:</strong> If the platform serves users in the European Union, it fully complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Students and professors are given control over their data, including the right to access, rectify, or erase their personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Monitoring and Incident Response:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Activity Monitoring:</strong> The platform continuously monitors for unusual or unauthorized activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, suspicious file uploads) to prevent potential breaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> In case of a security breach or data exposure, the platform has an incident response plan in place to notify affected users promptly, mitigate the damage, and secure the platform from further attacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. User Education:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Awareness: </strong> Users are educated about best practices in online security, such as using strong passwords, recognizing phishing attempts, and protecting their accounts with two-factor authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Guidance for Safe Sharing: </strong> Professors are encouraged to upload notes and materials in a secure format (e.g., password-protected PDFs) when sensitive information is shared, and students are advised against sharing personal details within notes.</li>
